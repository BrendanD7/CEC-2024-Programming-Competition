# Compilation Instructions
The code is written within 2 different frameworks.
In the back-end folder, we have a Flask Server in Python.
- To run this, navigate into the back-end folder and run `python main.py` which should open a localhost server.
In the front-end folder, we have a React Website.
- To run this, navigate into the front-end folder and run `npm start` which should open the website within a server.
   - Before doing this, ensure you run npm install to verify you have all of the packages installed, install any that are missing.
